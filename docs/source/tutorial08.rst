EAST Detector for Text Detection
------------------------------------

OpenCV’s EAST(Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detection ) text detector is a deep learning model, based on a novel architecture and training pattern. It is capable of running at near real-time at 13 FPS on 720p images and obtains state-of-the-art text detection accuracy.

OpenCV’s text detector implementation of EAST is quite robust, capable of localizing text even when it’s blurred, reflective, or partially obscured.
